# Yours-Generatively
Can a piece of code of become personal? Can it evoke feelings of love, fear or disgust.These are some of my experiments with algorithm to create some personal pieces.Some were meticulously planned, others were inspired by personal favourites and while some were just chance discovery. The Music in You This piece is a visualization of one of my songs on the favourite playlist apocalypse from Cigarette after sex. I tried to evoke the mood and feel of the songs in the piece. The Spread This piece eerily gives me a sensation of something spreading virally, like a bodily infection. But it  was not made with that intentions. It's interesting to see how our perception toward imagery changed based on the things we experience.   Maybe the thing of beauty, won't bring you the same joy. The fall This was the original version from the spread piece. A little perspective distortion gave it the form of a water fall. Recamán's sequence I came across Recamán's sequence visuals and I knew I had to make one. This hypnotizing sequence is based on recurrence relation and one cannot help but think about Physicist Richard Feynman views on beauty. Can aesthetics, as I would like to call it ,  truly exist in the lowest form of numbers and sequence.
